# Pi-Hole

Pi-Hole as virtual machine inside of Proxmox - In Progress

Ubuntu 22.04 lxc

Set ip to 192.168.0.2/24 in the LXC setings

Immediatly ran update && upgrade

Ran the wget command from pi-hole.net

It's working... set my laptop to the DNS of pi-hole

Set my router interface to the DNS of pi-hole with a backup resolver incase my proxmox server goes down

All done!
